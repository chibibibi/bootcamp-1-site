                    <h2>A Little More About Charlie</h2>
                    <p>I grew up in Fresno, CA and graduated from Clovis West High School in 2008. I moved to Missouri for 4 years and graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Christian Ministry from Ozark Christian College. While I was in college, I had amazing opportunities to serve around the world including Mexico, Canada, Costa Rica, Hong Kong, and Laos. I enjoy traveling and meeting new people around the globe.</p>
                    <p>After I graduated I moved back to Fresno to help my dad create an online business. During this time, I met and married my better half, Jen. She is a teacher and is very passionate about what she does. I am thankful to have her in my life. After working with my dad for 2 years, the business had grown to the point where he was able to retire from his contracting work. I am currently working as a dispatcher for Sonitrol Security, but my <strong>passion</strong> is in web development. I am thankful to be a student at Geekwise academy and am looking forward to what the future holds for tech in Fresno.</p>
